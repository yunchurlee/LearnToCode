# LearnToCode
Mainly, I will talk about the use of Java at basic level programming level. 

Java is the creation of neccessity in the 1980s  by Jason Gosling, who is an wonderful software enginner.
The most important aspect of Java philosophy is making less mistakes for a programmer which always cost more than 
anything else in the programming world beside Object oritented programming which was hailed by smalltalk. 
You never know how many mistakes each individual programmer make in one project.
Less mistakes will save more time for an individual developer or a whole team. 
So you will see many unfamiliar concept in the Java such as Object, interface, abstract, type, and so on. 
All of them try to protect programmers to make mistakes in the holy greateness of Java Virtual Machine. 

The second important apsect of Java is Object Oriented Programming. Object oriented programming is more like to be 
described as computer scientists' effort to grapsh the real world phenonmenon into the abstract computer programming world. 
How people see the world can be directl trnaslated into programming logic rather than thinking in machine level. 

The third would be only coding once but run everywhere. You might not understand this concept idea. Long long time ago, every computer programs were limited to each different machine. Whenever there is in need of running different computer machine, computer programmers have to rewrite their programs for the other machine with same idea. Obviously this is waste of time. Jameson Gosling brought the idea of Virtual Machine into Java. You only need to code once!.. 

There are other more or less important aspects for Java as programming language but these 3 of them are mostly important to me. and
It would be great that you understand this idea. understand the philosophy of Java.
